# Team-Profile-Generator

- this project was for module 10 OOP and the goal of this project was to create a profile team generator with node js. 
I was able to write up the tests and get everything to pass, but I was unable to complete everything required for the project

-I was able to write the different roles and get them each to pass multiple tests as well as making sure that 'jest' and 'inquirer' worked correctly 
within the parameters of this project. I was just unable to make it generate the html and turn it into a dynamic application.

## USER-STORY

AS A manager
I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
SO THAT I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles

### ACCEPTANCE-CRITERIA

GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for my team members and their information
THEN an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input
WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML
THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address
WHEN I click on the GitHub username
THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab
WHEN I start the application
THEN I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
WHEN I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team
WHEN I select the engineer option
THEN I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu
WHEN I select the intern option
THEN I am prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu
WHEN I decide to finish building my team
THEN I exit the application, and the HTML is generated
